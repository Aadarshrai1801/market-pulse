"""
Public API of the `scraper` package - this is the only file other code
(app.py, products_config.py) needs to import from, and its surface is
unchanged from when this used to be a single scraper.py:

    from scraper import SITE_SEARCH_CONFIG, find_product_url, get_product_details, save_price_record

Internally, each retailer now lives in its own module
(scraper/carrefour.py, scraper/lulu.py, etc.) with two functions:

    find_url(product_name) -> product page URL, or raises ValueError
    scrape(url)             -> dict of scraped product details

To add a new retailer:
  1. Add its entry to SITE_SEARCH_CONFIG in config.py.
  2. Create scraper/<retailer>.py with find_url() and scrape().
  3. Import it below and add one line each to _FINDERS and _SCRAPERS.
That's it - app.py and products_config.py don't need to change.

Price storage lives in MongoDB (see mongo_store.py / db.py) rather than
products.xlsx. excel_store.py is kept in the repo only as a reference for
anyone who still wants a spreadsheet export - it isn't wired up anymore.
